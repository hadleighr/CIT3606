     <div id= text> Books are a great way to stretch your mind and dive into an alternate reality. Similar to watching a movie books bring 
        a story to life. Books are a great way to learn about different cultures and time periods. They can also be a great way to
        learn about yourself. Books can be a great way to escape reality and relax. They can also be a great way to learn new things. 
        Books can be a great way to connect with others. They can also be a great way to improve your vocabulary and writing skills.
